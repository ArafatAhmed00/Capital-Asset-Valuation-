PCS License Bid: Value-Based Management for Dreamland’s Wireless Market
Overview

This project focuses on developing a value-based business plan for a Personal Communication Services (PCS) license bid in the Republic of Dreamland. The project was done as a part of the course curriculum for Capital Investment and Decision Making. The Ministry of Telecommunications plans to introduce a third wireless operator in the 1800 MHz spectrum to enhance competition, reduce costs, and improve service quality. This project aims to determine the optimal bid for the PCS license using financial and operational data while applying value-based management principles.

        Create financial projections for the PCS license using a value-based approach.
        Estimate economic value through discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.

    Competitive Strategy:
        Evaluate Dreamland’s wireless market, including current operators, penetration rates, and revenue opportunities.
        Benchmark against international markets like Thailand for comparative insights.

    Optimal Concession Offer:
        Calculate the license fee to maximize value for both the bidding entity and the government.
